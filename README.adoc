An {ESPHome} configuration for the {Adafruit-FunHouse} development board powered by the {ESP32-S2}.
This configuration also includes an {Adafruit-MCP9808} temperature and humidity sensor.

== Usage

[NOTE]
====
Due to the fact that the ESP32-S2 is relatively new, ESPHome doesn't have full support for the microcontroller yet.
Many features are unavailable using the ESP-IDF framework, which works best with the new chip.
====

[NOTE]
====
Support for Linux on `aarch64` is still in the works for the ESP-IDF platform, so I suggest using `x86_64`.
====

. Clone the repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/esphome-funhouse.git
----

. Copy the file to the ESPHome configuration directory.
In my case, this directory is a name volume managed by {Podman}.
+
[source,sh]
----
cp esphome-funhouse/FunHouse.yaml ~/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes/esphome-config/_data/
